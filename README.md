# GymBros Database Project

•	We chose to simulate a gym with a usable interface for members, staff, and administrators with fully functional registration and simulation of real tasks, using a frontend/backend and a database

•	We used C# and SQL to undertake this challenge, where we ensured that singe-responsibility principles were respected, and that the database’s sole purpose was to update itself and fetch required data, while the backend handled the processing and determination of such info, and that the frontend was as flawless and foolproof as possible 

•	The login system, determination of user type, and the ”member” page were completed by me, using all of the mentioned procedures to account for user’s keypresses and sending back relevant messages, such as if they are late on payments, or have already registered their maximum number of classes

•	Received 20 out of 20 points
